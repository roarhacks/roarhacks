- 👋 Hi, I’m Rory (Docs & Socs) Thomas

- 👀 I’m interested in the development life cycle at all stages and how to harness the world of modern technology.

- 👨‍💻 I consider myself a web developer whose preferred tech stack is the MERN or SERN stacks with typescript if the use case is right.

- 💼 I have focused my career as a developer with one company called Life365inc. This is where I gained my experience with various technologies while following strict guidelines around security and performance.

- 📵 My non technical interests include exploring nature, cooking, and spending time with my wonderful son.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning a wide variety of things as I am still finding the limits of my computer science knowledge. I would like to start learning the following:
    ● GO
    ● Python
    ● HTMX

- 🎮 I recently started branching into game development through roblox and lua.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with tech enthusiasts that care about people, all people of all walks of life. I have a particular interest in encouraging new developers to learn behaviors that are critical to development such as:
    ● Time management
    ● Diligence
    ● Curiosity 
    ● Effective communication

- 👨🏼‍🎓 I am a graduate from the University of New Mexico (UNM, go lobos!). I studied business communication and ultimately finished with a liberal arts degree. I intend to return so that I can complete a double bachelors in computer science and psychology before working towards a masters and someday, a doctorate.
